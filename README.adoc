= libchrony

`libchrony` is a C library for monitoring `chronyd`. It communicates with
`chronyd` directly over Unix domain or UDP socket, not relying on `chronyc`.
It supports `chronyd` versions 1.29.1 and later.

The following reports are supported:

- activity
- authdata
- ntpdata
- rtcdata
- selectdata
- serverstats
- smoothing
- sources
- sourcestats
- tracking

The API is documented in the `chrony.h` header. An example application printing
all data from all supported reports is in `example-reports.c`.
